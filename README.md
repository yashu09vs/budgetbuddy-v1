BudgetBuddy v1
This is my first major Python project and also the first project Iâ€™ve uploaded to GitHub.
BudgetBuddy v1 is a simple expense tracker that lets you enter, store, and delete your daily expenses. It uses a basic graphical interface (built with Tkinter) and stores data in a local SQLite database.
This version is a working prototype and marks the beginning of this project.

Features:
- Add new expenses with category, date, and optional notes
- View all expenses in a list
- Delete selected expenses

Languages/Libraries used:
- Python
- Tkinter
- SQLite

Planned improvements (for v2):
- Search or filter expenses
- Monthly summary
- Better UI/UX

!!!NOTE IF TESTING THE CODE!!!
- run the db.py first then run main.py
